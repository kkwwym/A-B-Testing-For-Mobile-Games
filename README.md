# A/B Testing For Mobile Games

### Abstract
As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase.
This sort of "time gate" is usually seen in free-to-play models, and normally contains ads that can be skipped using credits. In this case the player requires to submit a specific number of "Keys", which also can be skipped in exchange of in-game purchases. The game Cookie Cats is planning to move  "time gates" from level 30 to 40, but they donâ€™t know by how much the user retention can be impacted by this decision.
In this project, I am going to analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to 40. In particular, analyze the impact on player retention.

### Walkthroughs
* Define Business Use Case 
* Define the Metrics
* Set the Hypothesis
* Data Preparation & Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Chi-squared test for A/B testing


### Methods
* A/B test
* Chi-squared test

### Results and Discussion
1-day retention
According to chi-squared test, there is no significant difference in retention rates between the two versions at the 5% significance level. We do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis that retention rate is the same for the two versions.
7-day retention
According to chi-squared test, there is a significant difference in retention rates at the 1% significance level. We reject null hypothesis and accept our alternative hypothesis that 7-day retention rate is higher when the gate is at level 30.

### Here are some thoughts  that I would like to share....
I was really surprised when I first heard that the A/B test is based on Statistics a few years ago.  As a student who graduated from the Department of Statistics, I have never heard of this principle.
After conducting some deep research, I found out that the principle behind A/B test it is actually very easy to understand, just like solving different types of hypothesis test problems .
Starting from the establishment of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, controlling the significant level, calculating the p-value by using statistical software, confirming the sample size, and finally deciding whether we should accept or reject the null hypothesis.
It is easy to design how to apply A/B test if you already understand the principle. I think the real difficulty is what data metrics we have to determine. I realized that this domain knowledge is another important ability after having statistical knowledge and programming ability.  Therefore, I will explore different fields and topics whenever I do a new project. On the one hand, I can expose different domain knowledge and get to know new definitions of data metrics. Moreover, I will relentlessly remain curious about unknown fields.
In this case, even though I am a person who rarely plays games in my daily life, the biggest advantage of this is that how to explain this project in a way that an amateur can understand easily. Besides,  I can let  someone who is not interested in games like me be attracted as well. It is a good way to increase retention rate. Donâ€˜t you think so?
